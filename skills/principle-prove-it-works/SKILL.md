# Prove It Works

Verify every task output by checking the real thing directly. Do not infer from proxies, self-reports, or "it compiles."

**Why:** Unverified work has unknown correctness. Indirect verification (file mtimes, output freshness, agent self-reports, cached screenshots) feels cheaper than direct observation. Acting on a wrong inference costs far more than checking the source.

**Pattern:** After completing any task, ask: "how do I prove this actually works?"

Check the real thing, not a proxy:

- Check process liveness directly, not indirectly through derived state
- Read the actual value, not a cached or derived representation
- When verification fails, suspect the observation method before suspecting the system

Code and features:

1. Build it (necessary but not sufficient)
2. Run it and exercise the actual feature path
3. Check the full chain: does data flow from input to output?
4. For integrations, test the full communication path end-to-end

Delegation: trust artifacts, not self-reports.
When verifying delegated work, inspect the actual output artifact (git diff, file contents, runtime behavior), not the delegate's summary. Agents report what they intended, not always what happened.

## Script the check when you can

The strongest proof is a deterministic script that re-runs the same comparison, not a one-time eyeball. Write the script, run it, and keep its output as an artifact a reviewer can re-run instead of trusting your word. A script comparing the old and new compiled output catches what a glance misses.

Keep the artifact visible for the human: leave it unstaged in the working tree and name its path in the handover. Do not commit it and do not push it. The human commits. For a large port or migration where the trail has to stay auditable, say so in the handover so the human can decide what to keep (the **show-me-your-work** skill).

Two limits on this section. Keeping the artifact is for a check the task requires. A one-off command you ran to convince yourself, and would never run again, belongs in the handover as evidence rather than in the tree. And prove the thing the request asked for. A defect you find beside it, that the request does not depend on, is reported open instead of folded into this diff.
